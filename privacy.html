                <p>
                    CES Pay has deployed administrative, technical, and physical security measures to safeguard user’s Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information. Specifically, in order to safeguard your Aadhaar information, we have implemented applicable security controls as given under and required by the Aadhaar Regulations. We understand that as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. Hence, as part of our reasonable security practices, we undergo strict internal and external reviews to ensure appropriate information security encryption or controls are placed for both data in motion and data at rest within our network and servers respectively. The database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is strictly limited.
                    <br>
                    Further, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your login id and password. Please do not share your CES Pay login, password, and OTP details with anybody. It shall be your responsibility to intimate us in case of any actual or suspected compromise to your Personal Information.
                    <br>
                    We have provided multiple levels of security to safeguard the CES Pay Application by login/logout option and CES Pay Application lock feature (“Enable Screen Lock”) that can be enabled by you. We have preventive controls implemented to ensure you use CES Pay Application on your device and the same login credentials cannot be used on different device without any additional authentication/OTP.
