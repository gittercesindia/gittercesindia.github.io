          <div class="c-faq__answer">In many cases, if left unmolested, alligators eventually will retreat to more preferred habitats away from people. However, if you encounter an animal that poses a threat to human safety:
    <br />
    DON’T – swim outside of posted swimming areas or in waters that might contain large alligators.
            <br />
    DO – swim with a partner within all marked swimming areas. These areas are specifically situated and designed to reduce potential alligator/human conflicts.
            <br/ >
    DON’T – swim at night or dusk when alligators most actively feed.
